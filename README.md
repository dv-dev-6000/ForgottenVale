## The Game

### Overview
This project was created with Monogame in C# for the 2nd year Graded Unit as part of the Edinburgh College Game Development HND course. The aim was to create a game around the theme Environmental Change, it's a retro style 2D RPG adventure with turn based combat, character development and recruitable companions. The game requires a controller and runs on windows.

The player controls 'the Wanderer' who stumbles on an ancient tablet shard in the woods. This triggers a series of events which requires them to set out on an adventure to find the forgotten vale, reassemble the gaia tablet and restore order to the changing world.
